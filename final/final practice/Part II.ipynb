    "In this (optional) part of the exam, you will demonstrate your understanding of PIC 16 common topics by implementing a hash table data structure. Let's start by discussing how hash tables work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first week of the course, we introduced the Python `set` and discussed that locating and removing elements from a `set` can be performed very efficiently. In fact, adding elements to, locating elements within, and removing elements from a `set` is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _much_ faster than finding items in an unordered `list`, $O(N)$, in all but pathological cases; \n",
    "* usually faster than finding elements in a _sorted_ list using binary search, $O(\\log N)$; \n",
    "* and typically about as fast as finding a location in a `list` by index, $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's about as fast as it gets for such operations. The same speed applies to keys in a `dict`, and in Python, this speed in both `set`s and `dict`s is due to their implementation using hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `HashTable` class will work like a `set` in that \n",
    "\n",
    "* elements can be found, added, and removed quickly;\n",
    "* an element is not added at particular place (using, say, an index or key), rather an element is simply _in_ or _not in_ the `HashTable`; and \n",
    "* when we iterate over a `HashTable`, elements may be returned in any order. \n",
    " \n",
    "However, our `HashTable` will differ from a `set` in that it can contain duplicate elements (sort of like an `unordered_multiset` in C++). \n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables get their speed at the expense of memory. When a hash table is created, a large block of memory like a C++ array or Python list is pre-allocated. In our implementation, we'll actually start by making a big Python `list`, and this is where the elements of our `HashTable` will actually be stored. The difference is that our `HashTable` object will decide the index at which elements should go in the list rather than letting the programmer decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add an item to our hash table, we'll use a _hash function_ to calculate the index within the list where the item should be stored. A hash function is not something scary. It's just a function that accepts a string or other object as an input and outputs a non-negative integer, called a _hash_ which we'll use as an index. If the hash function is efficient, then adding an element to our hash table is super fast. We just use the hash function to calculate the hash, jump to that index, and write the element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables really shine when it comes to searching for elements and removing them. To find an element within our hash table, we'll use the same hash function to calculate the index where the element must be (if it is present). Once the index is known, we just jump to the index and check whether it's there. We can also remove it (say, by overwriting it with `None`) if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the alternative, in which a programmer has decided the index number at which each element will go, or even has just pushed them onto the end of the list. When we need to find an arbitrary element, we have to look through each element in the list until we find the one we're looking for or get to the end. The longer the list is, the longer this takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By letting the hash function decide where elements go, we eliminate all the time that would have to be spent searching through a list element by element. It doesn't matter how big the hash table gets; we just calculate the index of the desired element using the hash function and jump straight to that location. If it's there, great; if it's not, it's not in our hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like when you have designated places for items in an (organized) apartment rather than just tossing them wherever. It's much faster to find them when they're in the right place than looking in every possible place consecutively.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one caveat: even good hash functions occasionally return the same index for different elements. You can see how this might be a problem - if we want to store elements `a` and `b` in the hash table but the hash function decides calculates the same index for each, there's a conflict. We can't store both at the exact same memory location. This is called a _collision_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, it's an easy problem to fix. Rather than storing elements in the list directly, at each index of the list we'll store a reference to another list, which is called a _bucket_. When we want to put elements in our hash table, we'll put them in the appropriate bucket. Sure, now we'll have to look through the bucket element by element if we want to find a given element, but that's no big deal because if our hash function is good and our hash table has enough buckets, there will rarely be more than a few elements in each bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all the introduction we need to move along with the exam, but you are welcome to refer to the <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table\">Hash table</a> entry of Wikipedia for more information. Note, however, that the Wikipedia entry discusses hash tables in the context of an \"associative array\", which is like a \"map\" or `dict`. The important ideas behind our `HashTable` will be the same, but it's like our `HashTable` will only need to store the keys (no values), and we can have duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by writing a hash function that can convert a string to an integer (which we could use as an index, if we pre-allocate enough memory). One such hash function is described in the documentation for a <a href = \"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#hashCode()\">Java string</a>. Given a string $s$ composed of unicode character codes $s_0$, $s_1$, $\\dots$, $s_{n-1}$, the hash function $h(s)$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h(s) = 31^{n-1}s_0 + 31^{n-2}s_1 + \\cdots + 31^1s_{n-2} + 31^0 s_{n-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Implement this hash function as `my_hash` below. Don't worry about using \"integer arithmetic\" as described in the Java documentation; just ensure that the result is an `int` when you're done. Regarding character codes, there's a Python built-in function that accepts a character - that is, a string of length 1 -  and returns the code. For full credit here and throughout the exam, write as \"pythonically\" as possible. Your code should be succinct, memory efficient, and fast, taking advantage of appropriate Python language features and built-in functions as appropriate.  "
