    "A. Each can be used independent of the other. `^` is put at the beginning of a regular expression pattern to indicate the pattern appear at the beginning of the string to be considered a match. `$` is put at the end of a regular expression pattern to indicate the pattern must appear at the end of the string  to be considered a match. You might see `^` at the beginning without `$` at the end because you want to specify how a string begins but not how it ends. (Vice-versa is also true). If you put `^` at the beginning _and_ `$` at the end, then you are specifying how a string must begin and end to be considered a match.\n",

    "Note that you might also see `^` within square brackets, but that means something totally different, something like \"not\".\n",

    "A. Yes. Consider if you are trying to find portable document format (`.pdf`) files. You have three files.\n",

    "c.pdf.txt\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "The third is a text file, not a `.pdf` file. `c.pdf` is its name, `.txt` is its extension. Don't ask my why you have a file named like that, but it's possible and that sort of thing absolutely does happen in practice.\n",
    "So if you want a regular expression that matches only true `.pdf` filenames, you'll want to ensure that `.pdf` appears at the very end, e.g. `r\".+\\.pdf$\"` \n",
